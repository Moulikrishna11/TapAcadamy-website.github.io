        <h1>Why ta Structures and Algorithms?</h1>
     </center>
     <h2>what is ta Structures?</h2>
     <p>Look around you! The whole world revolves around information and ta. As a result, ta and information are integral to ily. 
        However, that ta <br> must be stored somewhere where it can be easily accessed and processed.
        That's where ta Structures come into the picture! </p>
    
        <h2>What are the types of ta structure ?</h2>
        <p>There are two types of ta Structure</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Linear ta Structures
                If the elements in the ta Structure are arranged in a sequential manner one after the other then it is called a Linear ta Structure.  
                A sequential arrangement makes it easy to access elements. <br>                
                Examples of Linear ta structures are Array, Linked List, Stack, and Queue.
            </li> <br>
            <li>Non-linear ta Structures

                Unlike Linear ta Structure, if the elements are not arranged in a sequential manner then it is called a Non-Linear ta Structure.   
                Instead, theyâ€™re connected in a hierarchical manner where one element connects to multiple elements. <br>            
                Examples of Non-Linear ta Structures are Graphs, Trees. 
                
            </li>
        </ol><br>
        <h2> Why ta structure</h2>
        <p>ta Structure is the key component of the programming world and helps in solving real-life complex problems.
            ta Structures are widely used in AI/ML, operating systems, and other sectors.    
            Understanding ta Structures gives you a clear understanding of how a ta-based problem can be solved efficiently.     
            Moreover, if you want to land an IT job in your dream company then ta Structures are a must.    
            Because ta Structure is part of the interview and hiring process.    
            Product-based companies check for the strength of ta Structures so that you can help them with their y-to-y problems.     
            If a candite is unaware of ta Structures then he'll not be able to write efficient code.    
            Based on the project, it's crucial to choose the right ta structure for your project.
