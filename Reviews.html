            LAXMI DEVI INSTITUTE OF ENGG. AND TECHNOLOGY
            <p>I joined the Java Full Stack Developer course
                in Tap Academy. The trainers are very good
                and supportive. They help me to clarify my
                all doubt. I have learned Java,SQL,HTML,Css
                and other languages. Each and every
                concept that is present in LMS is from
                Scratch that builds a good foundation to
                clarify upcoming advance topics. Thank you

            TAP ACADAMY STUDENT
            <p>Being from an IT background but still felt
                some missing pieces which TapAcademy
                has been filling. I have never felt such kind of
                experience anywhere. From explaining things
                in visual forms to bringing countless
                placement offers for us. And my basic is so
                strong now. College definitely has a
                curriculum and they have to follow it but
                here they are so focused on building our
                basics, personality and everything. Best
                experience honestly.

                    knowledge, experienced and the way of
                    teaching the concept is clear and excellent.
                    They clarify the doubts clearly as soon as
                    possible. They helped me to improve my
                    skillset. Now I gained the confidence to
                    attend the interviews. Thank you for the
